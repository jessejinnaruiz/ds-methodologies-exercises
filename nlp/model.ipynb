      "After world's fourth-richest person Warren Buffett claimed carmaker Tesla cannot sell insurance, Tesla's CEO Elon Musk responded with a series of tweets on Sunday. In his first tweet, Musk urged users to buy Tesla Model 3, claiming it's cheaper than a Honda Accord. \"Also 1000 times more fun!\" and \"That's a direct quote from Warren Buffett,\" his next tweets read.\n",
      "Gujarat-based diamond trader Savji Dholakia, who's known for gifting cars to his employees, has said he'll remove a 'kutcha' road built by him across the dry Narmada river to reach his farmhouse. This comes after government officials visited the spot on learning about the illegal structure. Meanwhile, Dholakia said his only intention was to enable people to reach the island.\n",
      "World's fourth-richest person, Warren Buffett, has said that he will \"never hesitate even for a second to fly on a Boeing 737 MAX plane\" which was involved in two crashes that claimed the lives of 346 people. He was responding to a question about damage to Boeing's reputation after the crashes. \"Planes have never been so safe,\" Buffett added.\n",
      "Activists in Hyderabad have claimed that Infosys deducting parking charges from employees' salary is illegal. Infosys charges ₹500 for four-wheelers and ₹250 for two-wheelers per month to park on the campus located in the Pocharam Special Economic Zone in city's outskirts. The management reportedly responded to employee complaints by saying the fee was being collected to maintain the parking lot.\n",
      "US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Monday said that his country cannot ensure the sale of oil to India at cheaper rates to compensate for the loss of Iranian oil. \"Oil is owned by private people, so the government cannot force people to make concessionary prices,\" Ross said.
